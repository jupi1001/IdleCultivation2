# Idle Game

npm run dev


## TODO
- Add more combat loot
- Add misc items like rings, amuletts
- Add images for combat techniques and  qi techniques
- Add shoes and legs(maybe only for skilling sets)
- All skill expansion with content to level 99
- **Immortals Island (Phase 2)** – Avatars, “send avatar” flow
**Phase 2 – Avatars**:
  - **Avatar**: A second “character” that can be sent on expeditions so the **main** can keep cultivating. Add `avatars: AvatarI[]` to state; each has `id`, `name`, `power` (single stat, no attack/defense/health), `isBusy`, `expeditionEndTime`. Increase power via: (1) avatar meditation when not on expedition; (2) main spends qi pills (or spirit stones) to train avatar.
  - **Unlock**: Unlock “Create Avatar” at a certain realm or after first Immortals Island mission. Creating an avatar could cost spirit stones and/or qi.
  - **Flow**: Choose mission → choose “Main” or one of the avatars → start timer. Only the chosen entity is busy; others can continue their activities. Main continues cultivating; avatars only do expeditions (or you can later let them “train” offline).
- Sect phase 2
    - Phase2:
     **To get items from the demonic sect you have to battle them. So if you are a core displicine in your rightous sect you can battle a demonic sect and then get the loot from a loot table up to the core displicne level.**
- All skill expansion with content to level 120
