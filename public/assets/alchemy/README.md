# Alchemy / pill images

Place images here. The app expects assets under `public/assets/alchemy/` (see `src/constants/alchemy.ts`).

**Option 1 – one image for all pills (current behavior):**
- `potion1.webp` — used for every pill until you add per-pill assets.

**Option 2 – one image per pill (if you add support in code):**

Use these filenames so each pill can have its own icon:

- `basic-qi-pill.webp`
- `spirit-qi-pill.webp`
- `refined-qi-pill.webp`
- `condensation-pill.webp`
- `foundation-pill.webp`
- `herb-vitality-pill.webp`
- `lunar-qi-pill.webp`
- `stellar-condensation-pill.webp`
- `void-refined-pill.webp`
- `celestial-qi-pill.webp`
- `transcendent-qi-pill.webp`
- `spirit-vitality-pill.webp`
- `refined-vitality-pill.webp`
- `primordial-vitality-pill.webp`
- `transcendent-vitality-pill.webp`
